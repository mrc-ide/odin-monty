# Inference {#sec-inference}

Getting started with inference on odin models.

We'll cover similar ground to the odin fitting vignette I think in this first chapter of this part.  The later chapters will cover:

* observing the process
* multiple parameter sets and parameter packing
* restarts (once enabled)
* multistage fits (once enabled)
