# Monty

Before showing how to fit odin models to data, we'll focus for a bit on monty itself.  If you are anxious to get on and fit the model from @sec-data-filter, might skip ahead to @sec-inference, where we resume this.

There are a bunch of things we want to cover in this chapter so likely it will be split into a few:

* defining a model in monty, both easily with `monty_function` and less easily with `monty_model`
* fitting models with mcmc
* writing priors with the `monty_dsl`
* using observers to follow along with the model (if we can come up with a good example)
* working with nested models (once we write the code that would allow this)
* running mcmc chains in parallel
* exporting chains to work with other packages
* different samplers

Hmm, there really is quite a bit of ground to cover here!
